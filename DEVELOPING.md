# Developing

Welcome to the Stellar Go monorepo. These instructions help launch 🚀 you into making and testing code changes to this repository.

For details about what's in this repository and how it is organized read the [README.md](README.md).

If you're aiming to submit a contribution make sure to also read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're making changes to Horizon, look for documentation in its [docs](services/horizon/internal/docs) directory for specific instructions.

## Requirements
To checkout, build, and run most tests these tools are required:
- Git
- [Go 1.13 or Go 1.14](https://golang.org/dl)

To run some tests these tools are also required:
- PostgreSQL 9.6+ server running locally, or set [environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/libpq-envars.html) (e.g. `PGHOST`, etc) for alternative host.
- MySQL 10.1+ server running locally.

## Get the code

Check the code out anywhere, using a `GOPATH` is not required.

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/go
```

## Installing dependencies

Dependencies are managed using [Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). Dependencies for the packages you are building will be installed automatically when running any Go command that requires them. If you need to pre-download all dependencies for the repository for offline development, run `go mod download`.

See [Dependency management](#dependency-management) for more details.

## Running tests

```
go test ./...
```

## Running services/tools

```
go run ./services/<service>
```

```
go run ./tools/<tool>
```

## Dependency management

Dependencies are managed using [Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and are tracked in the repository across three files:
- [go.mod](go.mod): Contains a list of direct dependencies, and some indirect dependencies (see [why](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#why-does-go-mod-tidy-record-indirect-and-test-dependencies-in-my-gomod)).
- [go.sum](go.sum): Contains hashes for dependencies that are used for verifying downloaded dependencies.
- [go.list](go.list): A file that is unique to this Go repository, containing the output of `go list -m all`, and captures all direct and indirect dependencies and their versions used in builds and tests within this repository. This is not a lock file but instead it helps us track over time which versions are being used for builds and tests, and to see when that changes in PR diffs.

### Adding new dependencies

Add new dependencies by adding the import paths to the code. The next time you execute a Go command the tool will update the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

To add a specific version of a dependency use `go get`:

```
go get <importpath>@<version>
```

Go modules files track the minimum dependency required, not the exact dependency version that will be used. To validate the version of the dependency being used update the `go.list` file by running `go mod -m all > go.list`.

Before opening a PR make sure to run these commands to tidy the module files:
- `go mod tidy`
- `go list -m all > go.list`

### Updating a dependency

Update an existing dependency by using `go get`:

```
go get <importpath>@<version>
```

Go modules files track the minimum dependency required, not the exact dependency version that will be used. To validate the version of the dependency being used update the `go.list` file by running `go mod -m all > go.list`.

Before opening a PR make sure to run these commands to tidy the module files:
```
go mod tidy
go list -m all > go.list
```

### Removing a dependency

Remove a dependency by removing all import paths from the code, then use the following commands to remove any unneeded direct or indirect dependencies:

```
go mod tidy
go list -m all > go.list
```

Note: `go list -m all` may show that the dependency is still being used. It will be possible that the dependency is still an indirect dependency. If it's important to understand why the dependency is still being used, use `go mod why <importpath>/...` and `go mod graph | grep <importpath>` to understand which modules are importing it.

### Reviewing changes in dependencies

When updating or adding dependencies it's critical that we review what the
changes are in those dependencies that we are introducing into our builds. When
dependencies change the diff for the `go.list` file may be too complex to
understand. In those situations use the [golistcmp] tool to get a list of
changing modules, as well as GitHub links for easy access to diff review.

```
git checkout master
go list -m -json all > go.list.master
git checkout <branch>
golistcmp go.list.master <(go list -m -json all)
```
