// Package httptest enhances the stdlib net/http/httptest package by integrating
// it with gopkg.in/gavv/httpexpect.v1, reducing the boilerplate needed for http
// tests.  In addition to the functions that make it easier to stand up a test
// server, this package also provides a set of tools to make it easier to mock
// out http client responses.
//
// Test Servers vs. Client mocking
//
// When building a testing fixture for HTTP, you can approach the problem in two
// ways:  Use a mocked server and make real http requests to the server, or use
// a mocked client and have _no_ server.  While this package provides facilities
// for both, we recommend that you follow the conventions for decided which to
// use in your tests.
//
// The test server system should be used when the object under test is our own
// server code; usually that means our own http.Handler implementations.  The
// mocked client system should be used when the object under test is making http
// requests.
