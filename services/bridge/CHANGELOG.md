# Changelog

As this project is pre 1.0, breaking changes may happen for minor version bumps. A breaking change will get clearly notified in this log.

## Unreleased

## Changes
* Payload MAC authentication uses `X-Payload-Mac` header (old `X_PAYLOAD_MAC` header is still provided for backward compatibility, but it is deprecated and will be removed in future versions).

## 0.0.31

### Breaking changes
* `id` parameter is now required when sending payments using Compliance Protocol.

### Changes
* `nonce` value does not change when repeating Auth Request after receiving `pending` status.
* Support for sending XLM using Compliance Protocol.
* Fix for #109

Please migrate your `compliance` DB before running a new version using: `compliance --migrate-db`.

## 0.0.30

* Support for "Forward federation" destinations.

## 0.0.29

* Improved transaction submission code:
  * High rate transaction submission using `/payment` endpoint should work better.
  * Added `id` parameter to `/payment` request: payments with `id` set, when resubmitted, are using previously created transaction envelope stored in a DB instead of recreating a transaction with a new sequence number. This can prevent accidental double-spends.
* Fix for a bug in `/builder` endpoint: sequence number is now incremented when loaded from Horizon server (https://github.com/stellar/bridge-server/issues/86).
* Payment listener is now also sending `account_merge` operations and, for each operation, a new parameter: `transaction_id`.
* Updated `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` dependency.

Read `README` file for more information about new features.

Please migrate your `bridge` DB before running a new version using: `bridge --migrate-db`
