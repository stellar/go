# regulated-assets-approval-server

```sh
Status: supports SEP-8 transactions revision with a simplified rule:
- only revises transactions containing a single operation of type payment.
- payments whose amount does not meet the configured threshold are considered compliant and revised according to the SEP-8 specification.
- payments with an amount exceeding the threshold need further action.
- transactions already compliant with SEP-8 that don't need to be revised will be signed and returned with the "success" SEP-8 status.

Note: SEP-8 states the service should be able to handle offers in addition to payments, but we're not supporting that at the moment.
```

This is a [SEP-8] Approval Server reference implementation based on SEP-8 v1.7.1
intended for **testing only**. It is being conceived to:

1. Be used as an example of how regulated assets transactions can be validated
   and revised by an anchor.
2. Serve as a demo server where wallets can test and validate their SEP-8
   implementation.

## Account Setup

In order to properly use this server for regulated assets, the account whose
secret was added in `--issuer-account-secret (ISSUER_ACCOUNT_SECRET)` needs to
be configured according with SEP-8 [authorization flags] by setting both
`Authorization Required` and `Authorization Revocable` flags. This allows the
issuer to grant and revoke authorization to transact the asset at will.

You can use the command [`$ regulated-assets-approval-server
configure-issuer`](#usage-configure-issuer) or [this Stellar Laboratory
link](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#txbuilder?params=eyJhdHRyaWJ1dGVzIjp7ImZlZSI6IjEwMCIsImJhc2VGZWUiOiIxMDAiLCJtaW5GZWUiOiIxMDAifSwiZmVlQnVtcEF0dHJpYnV0ZXMiOnsibWF4RmVlIjoiMTAwIn0sIm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiOlt7ImlkIjowLCJhdHRyaWJ1dGVzIjp7InNldEZsYWdzIjozfSwibmFtZSI6InNldE9wdGlvbnMifV19)
to set those flags.

After setting up the issuer account you can send some amount of the regulated
asset to a stellar account using the servers friendbot
`friendbot/?addr={stellar_address}` endpoint. The friendbot endpoint is not part
of the SEP-8 Approval Server specification, it's a debug feature that allows
accounts to test sending transactions containing payments with the issuer's
regulated asset, to the server.

### `GET /friendbot?addr={stellar_address}`

This endpoint sends a payment of 10,000 (this value is configurable) regulated
assets to the provided `addr`. Please be aware the address must first establish
a trustline to the regulated asset in order to receive that payment. You can use
[this
link](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#txbuilder?params=eyJhdHRyaWJ1dGVzIjp7ImZlZSI6IjEwMCIsImJhc2VGZWUiOiIxMDAiLCJtaW5GZWUiOiIxMDAifSwiZmVlQnVtcEF0dHJpYnV0ZXMiOnsibWF4RmVlIjoiMTAwIn0sIm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiOlt7ImlkIjowLCJhdHRyaWJ1dGVzIjp7ImFzc2V0Ijp7InR5cGUiOiJjcmVkaXRfYWxwaGFudW00IiwiY29kZSI6IiIsImlzc3VlciI6IiJ9fSwibmFtZSI6ImNoYW5nZVRydXN0In1dfQ%3D%3D&network=test)
to do that in Stellar Laboratory.

## API Spec

### `POST /tx-approve`

This is the core [SEP-8] endpoint used to validate and process regulated assets
transactions. Its response will contain one of the following statuses:
[Success], [Revised], [Action Required], or [Rejected].

Note: The example responses below have set their `base-url` env var configured
to `"https://example.com"`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "tx": "AAAAAgAAAAA0Nk3++mfFw4Is6OaUJTKe71XNtxdktcjGrPildK84xAAAJxAAAJ3YAAAABwAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAARllVv+K58Rbwzc/2Ti1IsisLC03udNJblQx2sPLfDygAAAAJNWVVTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAqjdTmDnuZm4YrIZ3wQVmVXmWSMO4dLk5dOPzUjWDvIgAAAABKp6IgAAAAAAAAAABdK84xAAAAEACHShDhulyTyvFx9lCU2LjAN9P7g6XqZJ6aNKo/NFb+9awp4pE5soK5cTtahhVzx9RsUcH+FSRmOPu4YEqqBsK"
}
```

**Responses:**

_Success:_ means the transaction has been approved and signed by the issuer
without being revised. For more info read the SEP-8 [Success] section.

```json

and signed by the issuer. For more info read the SEP-8 [Revised] section.

```json
{
  "status": "revised",
  "message": "Authorization and deauthorization operations were added.",
  "tx": "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"
}
```

_Rejected:_ this response means the transaction is not and couldn't be made
compliant. For more info read the SEP-8 [Rejected] section.

```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "error": "There is one or more unauthorized operations in the provided transaction."
}
```

_Action Required:_ this response means the user must complete an action before this transaction can
be approved. The approval server will provide a URL that facilitates the action.
Upon completion, the user can resubmit the transaction. For more info read the
SEP-8 [Action Required] section.

```json
{
  "status": "action_required",
  "message": "Payments exceeding 500.00 GOAT needs KYC approval. Please provide an email address.",
  "action_url": "https://example.com/kyc-status/cf4fe081-5b38-48b6-86ed-1bcfb7171c7d",
  "action_method": "POST",
  "action_fields": [
    "email_address"
  ]
}
```

_Pending:_ this response means the user KYC could not be verified as approved
nor rejected and was marked as "pending". As an arbitrary rule, this server is
marking as "pending" all accounts whose email starts with "y". For more info
read the SEP-8 [Pending] section.

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "error": "Your account could not be verified as approved nor rejected and was marked as pending. You will need staff authorization for operations above 500.00 GOAT."
}
```

### `POST /kyc-status/{CALLBACK_ID}`

This endpoint is used for the extra action after `/tx-approve`, as described in
the SEP-8 [Action Required] section.

Currently an arbitrary criteria is implemented:

* email addresses starting with "x" will have the KYC automatically denied.
* email addresses starting with "y" will have their KYC marked as pending.
* all other emails will be accepted.

_Note: you'll need to resubmit your transaction to
[`/tx_approve`](#post-tx-approve) in order to verify if your KYC was approved._

**Request:**

```json
{
  "email_address": "foo@bar.com"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "no_further_action_required",
}
```

After the user has been approved or rejected they can POST their transaction to
[`POST /tx-approve`](#post-tx-approve) for revision.

If their KYC was rejected they should see a rejection response.
**Response (rejected for emails starting with "x"):**

```json
{
  "status": "rejected",
  "error": "Your KYC was rejected and you're not authorized for operations above 500.00 GOAT."
}
```

If their KYC was marked as pending they should see a pending response.
**Response (pending for emails starting with "y"):**

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "error": "Your account could not be verified as approved nor rejected and was marked as pending. You will need staff authorization for operations above 500.00 GOAT."
}
```

### `GET /kyc-status/{STELLAR_ADDRESS_OR_CALLBACK_ID}`

Returns the detail of an account that requested KYC, as well some metadata about
its status.

_Note: This functionality is for test/debugging purposes and it's not
part of the [SEP-8] spec._

### `DELETE /kyc-status/{STELLAR_ADDRESS}`

Deletes a stellar account from the list of KYCs. If the stellar address is not
in the database to be deleted the server will return with a `404 - Not Found`.

_Note: This functionality is for test/debugging purposes and it's not part of
the [SEP-8] spec._

  "message": "ok"
