title: Effect
---

A successful operation will yield zero or more **effects**.  These effects
represent specific changes that occur in the ledger, but are not necessarily
directly reflected in the [ledger](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/ledger.html) or [history](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/history.md), as [transactions](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/transactions.html) and [operations](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/operations.html) are.

## Effect types

We can distinguish 4 effect groups:
- Account effects
- Signer effects
- Trustline effects
- Trading effects
