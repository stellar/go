title: Response Format
---

Rather than using a fully custom way of representing the resources we expose in
Horizon, we use [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). HAL is a
hypermedia format in JSON that remains simple while giving us a couple of
benefits such as simpler client integration for several languages. See [this
wiki page](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification/wiki/Libraries) for a
list of libraries.

## Attributes, Links, Embedded Resources

At its simplest, a HAL response is just a JSON object with a couple of reserved
property names:  `_links` is used for expressing links and `_embedded` is used
for bundling other HAL objects with the response.  Other than links and embedded
objects, **HAL is just JSON**.

### Links

HAL is a hypermedia format, like HTML, in that it has a mechanism to express
links between documents.  Let's look at a simple example:

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/ledgers/1"
    },
    "transactions": {
      "href": "/ledgers/1/transactions{?cursor,limit,order}",
      "templated": true
    }
  },
  "id": "43cf4db3741a7d6c2322e7b646320ce9d7b099a0b3501734dcf70e74a8a4e637",
  "hash": "43cf4db3741a7d6c2322e7b646320ce9d7b099a0b3501734dcf70e74a8a4e637",
  "prev_hash": "",
  "sequence": 1,
  "transaction_count": 0,
  "operation_count": 0,
  "closed_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "total_coins": "100000000000.0000000",
  "fee_pool": "0.0000000",
  "base_fee_in_stroops": 100,
  "base_reserve_in_stroops": 100000000,
  "max_tx_set_size": 50
}
```

The above response is for the genesis ledger of the Stellar test network, and
the links in the `_links` attribute provide links to other relavant resources in
Horizon.  Notice the object beneath the `transactions` key.  The key of each
link specifies that links relation to the current resource, and in this case
`transactions` means "Transactions that occurred in this ledger".  Logically,
you should expect that resource to respond with a collection of transactions
with all of the results having a `ledger_sequence` attribute equal to 1.

The `transactions` link is also _templated_, which means that the `href`
attribute of the link is actually a URI template, as specified by  [RFC
6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).  We use URI templates to show you
what parameters a give resource can take. You must evaluate the template to a
valid URI before navigating to it.

## Pages

Pages represent a subset of a larger collection of objects.
As an example, it would be unfeasible to provide the
[All Transactions](../reference/transactions-all.md) endpoint without paging.  Over time there
will be millions of transactions in the Stellar network's ledger and returning
them all over a single request would be unfeasible.

Read more about paging in following docs:
- [Page](../reference/resources/page.md)
- [Paging](./paging.md)

## Streaming

Certain endpoints in Horizon can be called in streaming mode using Server-Sent Events. This mode will keep the connection to horizon open and horizon will continue to return responses as ledgers close. All parameters for the endpoints that allow this mode are the same. The way a caller initiates this mode is by setting `Accept: text/event-stream` in the HTTP header when you make the request.
You can read an example of using the streaming mode in the [Follow Received Payments](./tutorials/follow-received-payments.md) tutorial.
