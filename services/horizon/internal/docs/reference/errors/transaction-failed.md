title: Transaction Failed
---

This error occurs when a client submits a transaction that was well-formed but was not included into the ledger due to some other failure. For example, a transaction may fail if:

- The source account for transaction cannot pay the minimum fee.
- The sequence number is incorrect.
- One of the contained operations has failed such as a payment operation that overdraws the paying account.

In almost every case, this error indicates that the transaction submitted in the initial request will never succeed.  There is one exception: a transaction that fails with the `tx_bad_seq` result code (as expressed in the `result_code` field of the error) may become valid in the future if the sequence number it used was too high.
