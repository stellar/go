title: Rate Limit Exceeded
---

When a single user makes too many requests to Horizon in a one hour time frame, Horizon returns a `rate_limit_exceeded` error. By default, Horizon allows 3600 requests per hour -- an average of one request per second.

If you are encountering this error, please reduce your request speed. Here are some strategies for doing so:
* For collection endpoints, try specifying larger page sizes.
* Try streaming responses to watch for new data instead of pulling data every time.
* Cache immutable data, such as transaction details, locally

See the [Rate Limiting Guide](../../reference/rate-limiting.md) for more info.

## Attributes
