title: Paging
---

The Stellar network contains a lot of data and it would be infeasible to return it all at once. The paging system allows
a user to request a "page" of data containing only a limited number of results. Then, the user can use the paging system
to request results adjacent to the current page where they left off at.

Read about the [page resource](../reference/resources/page.md) for information on the paging system's usage and representation.
