# Beta Testing New Ingestion System

This document aims to be a guide with all information needed to start testing new ingestion system in Horizon. If there are any issues you are facing not covered in this document, please add an issue in this repository. For questions please use [Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com) or ask it in one of our online [communities](https://www.stellar.org/community/#communities).

Please remember that this is still experimental version of the system!

Thank you for helping us test new ingestion system in Horizon!

## What is the new ingestion system?

The new ingestion system solves issues found in the previous version like: inconsistent data, relying on Stellar-Core database directly, slow responses for specific queries, etc. It allows new kind of features in Horizon, ex. faster path-finding. We published a [blog post](https://www.stellar.org/developers/blog/our-new-horizon-ingestion-engine) with more details, please check it out!

## Prerequisities

* The init stage (state ingestion) for public network requires around 1.5GB of RAM. The memory is released after the state ingestion. State ingestion is performed only once, restarting the server will not trigger it unless Horizon has been upgraded to a newer version (with updated ingestion pipeline). We are currently working on alternative solutions to make RAM requirements smaller however we believe that it will become smaller and smaller as more buckets are [CAP-20](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0020.md) compatible. The CPU footprint of the new ingestion is really small. We were able to run experimental ingestion on `c5.large` instance on AWS.
* The state data requires additional 1.3GB DB disk space (as of version 0.20.1).
* Flags needed to enable experimental ingestion:
  * `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_INGESTION=true`
  * `HISTORY_ARCHIVE_URLS="archive1,archive2,archive3"` (for public network you can use one of SDF's archives, ex. `https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-live/core_live_001`)

## Known issues

### Some endpoints are not available during state ingestion

Endpoints that display state information like `/paths` (built using offers) are not available during state ingestion and return `503 Service Unavailable`/`Still Ingesting` error. We are currently thinking whether to change this behaviour. The main argument against it is displaying stale data.

### State ingestion is taking a lot of time

State ingestion speed depends mostly on a database specs. In most cases so far the new system was able to ingest the state in around 30 minutes. We are currently working on making this process as fast as possible.

It's also possible that the progress logs (see below) will not show anything new for a longer period of time (>15 minutes) or print a lot of progress entries every few seconds. This is happening because of the way history archives are designed, the ingestion is still working but it's processing so called `DEADENTRY`'ies: if there is a lot of them in the bucket, there are no _active_ entries to process. We plan to improve the progress logs to display actual percentage progress so it's easier to estimate ETA.

If you see that ingestion is not proceeding for a very long period of time:
1. Check the RAM usage on the machine. It's possible that system run out of RAM and it using swap memory that is extremely slow.
2. If above is not the case, file a new issue in this repository.

## Reading the logs

In order to check the progress and the status of experimental ingestion you should check the logs. All logs connected to experimental ingestion are tagged with `service=expingest`.

It starts with informing you about state ingestion:
```
INFO[2019-08-29T13:04:13.473+02:00] Starting ingestion system from empty state...  pid=5965 service=expingest temp_set="*io.MemoryTempSet"

```
During state ingestion, Horizon will log number of processed entries every 100,000 entries (there are currently around 5.5M entries in the public network):
```

```
When state ingestion is finished it will proceed to ledger ingestion starting from the next ledger after checkpoint ledger (25565887+1 in this example) to update the state using transaction meta:
