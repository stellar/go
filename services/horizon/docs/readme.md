title: Horizon
---

Horizon is the server for the client facing API for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [stellar-core](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Stellar ecosystem](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/) for more details.

You can interact directly with horizon via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/learn/) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

SDF runs a instance of Horizon that is connected to the test net [https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/).
