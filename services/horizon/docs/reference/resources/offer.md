Accounts on the Stellar network can make [offers](http://stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/exchange.html) to buy or sell assets.  Users can create offers with the [Manage Offer](http://stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/list-of-operations.html) operation.

Horizon only returns offers that belong to a particular account.  When it does, it uses the following format:
