* Add support for getting the `TransactionEnvelope` struct with `Transaction.TxEnvelope` method ([#1415](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1415)).
* `AllowTrust` operations no longer requires the asset issuer, only asset code is required ([#1330](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1330)).
* `Transaction.SetDefaultFee` method is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release ([#1221](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1221)).
* `Transaction.TransactionFee` method has been added to get the fee that will be paid for a transaction.

* In addition to account responses from horizon, transactions and operations can now be built with txnbuild.SimpleAccount structs constructed locally ([#1266](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1266)). 
* Added `MaxTrustlineLimit` which represents the maximum value for a trustline limit ([#1265](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1265)).
* ChangeTrust operation with no `Limit` field set now defaults to `MaxTrustlineLimit` ([#1265](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/1265)).
