## Unreleased


## v2.0.0

This release is related to the release of [Horizon v2.3.0](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases/tag/horizon-v2.3.0) and introduces some breaking changes to the `ingest` package for those building their own tools.

### Breaking Changes
- Many APIs now require a `context.Context` parameter, allowing you to interact with the backends and control calls in a more finely-controlled manner. This includes the readers (`ChangeReader` et al.) as well as the backends themselves (`CaptiveStellarCore` et al.).

- **`GetLedger()` always blocks** now, even for an `UnboundedRange`.

- The `CaptiveCoreBackend` now requires an all-inclusive `CaptiveCoreToml` object to configure Captive Core rather than an assortment of individual parameters. This object can be built from a TOML file (see `NewCaptiveCoreTomlFromFile`) or from parameters (see `NewCaptiveCoreToml`) as was done before.

- `LedgerTransaction.Meta` has been renamed to `UnsafeMeta` to highlight that users should be careful when interacting with it.

- Remote Captive Core no longer includes the `present` field in the ledger response JSON.

### New Features
- `NewLedgerChangeReaderFromLedgerCloseMeta` and `NewLedgerTransactionReaderFromLedgerCloseMeta` are new ways to construct readers from a particular single ledger.

### Other Changes
- The remote Captive Core client timeout has doubled.

- Captive Core now creates a temporary directory (`captive-core-...`) in the specified storage path (current directory by default) that it cleans it up on shutdown rather than in the OS's temp directory.
