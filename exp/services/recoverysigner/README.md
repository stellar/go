# Recovery Signer

This is an incomplete and work-in-progress implementation of the [SEP-30]
Recovery Signer protocol.

A Recovery Signer is a server that can help a user regain control of a Stellar
account if they have lost their secret key. A user registers their account with
a Recovery Signer by adding it as a signer, and informs the Recovery Signer
that any user proving access to a phone number or email address can have
transactions signed. A user who has registered their account with two or more
Recovery Signers can recover the account with their help.

This implementation is not polished and is still experimental.
Running this implementation in production is not recommended.

## Usage

```
$ recoverysigner --help
SEP-XX Recovery Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner [command] [flags]
  recoverysigner [command]

Available Commands:
  serve       Run the SEP-XX Recover Signer server

Use "recoverysigner [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Usage: Serve

```
$ recoverysigner serve --help
Run the SEP-XX Recover Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner serve [flags]

Flags:
      --db-url string                Database URL (DB_URL) (default "postgres://localhost:5432/?sslmode=disable")
      --firebase-project-id string   Firebase project ID to use for validating Firebase JWTs (FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID)
      --network-passphrase string    Network passphrase of the Stellar network transactions should be signed for (NETWORK_PASSPHRASE) (default "Test SDF Network ; September 2015")
      --port int                     Port to listen and serve on (PORT) (default 8000)
      --sep10-jwks string            JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) containing exactly one key, which will be used to validate SEP-10 JWTs (if the key is an asymmetric key that has separate public and private key, the JWK need only be the public key) (SEP10_JWKS)
      --signing-key string           Stellar signing key used for signing transactions (will be deprecated with per-account keys in the future) (SIGNING_KEY)
```
