# Recovery Signer

This is an incomplete and work-in-progress implementation of the [SEP-30]
Recovery Signer protocol v0.4.0.

A Recovery Signer is a server that can help a user regain control of a Stellar
account if they have lost their secret key. A user registers their account with
a Recovery Signer by adding it as a signer, and informs the Recovery Signer
that any user proving access to a phone number or email address can have
transactions signed. A user who has registered their account with two or more
Recovery Signers can recover the account with their help.

This implementation uses Firebase to authenticate a user with an email address
or phone number. To configure a Firebase project for use with recoverysigner
see [README-Firebase.md](README-Firebase.md).

This implementation is not polished and is still experimental.
Running this implementation in production is not recommended.

## Usage

```
$ recoverysigner --help
SEP-30 Recovery Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner [command] [flags]
  recoverysigner [command]

Available Commands:
  db          Run database operations
  serve       Run the SEP-30 Recovery Signer server

Use "recoverysigner [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Usage: serve

```
$ recoverysigner serve --help
Run the SEP-30 Recover Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner serve [flags]

Flags:
      --admin-port int               Port to listen and serve admin functionality including metrics (ADMIN_PORT)
      --db-url string                Database URL (DB_URL) (default "postgres://localhost:5432/?sslmode=disable")
      --firebase-project-id string   Firebase project ID to use for validating Firebase JWTs (FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID)
      --metrics-namespace string     Namespace to use for metric names prefixed to metrics reported (METRICS_NAMESPACE) (default "recoverysigner")
      --network-passphrase string    Network passphrase of the Stellar network transactions should be signed for (NETWORK_PASSPHRASE) (default "Test SDF Network ; September 2015")
