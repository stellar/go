# txnbuild

`txnbuild` is a [Stellar SDK](https://www.stellar.org/developers/reference/), implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/). It provides a reference implementation of the complete [set of operations](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/list-of-operations.html) that compose [transactions](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/transactions.html) for the Stellar distributed ledger.

This project is maintained by the Stellar Development Foundation.

## Getting Started
This library is aimed at developers building Go applications on top of the [Stellar network](https://www.stellar.org/). Transactions constructed by this library may be submitted to any Horizon instance for processing onto the ledger, using any Stellar SDK client. The recommended client for Go programmers is [horizonclient](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/exp/clients/horizon). Together, these two libraries provide a complete Stellar SDK.
