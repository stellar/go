// Package federation provides a pluggable handler that satisfies the Stellar
// federation protocol.  Add an instance of `Handler` onto your router to allow
// a server to satisfy the protocol.
//
// The central type in this package is the "Driver" interfaces.  Implementing
// these interfaces allows a developer to plug in their own back end, whether it
// be a RDBMS, a KV store, or even just an in memory data structure.
//
// A pre-baked implementation of `Driver` and `ReverseDriver` that provides
// simple access to SQL systems is included. See `SQLDriver` for more details.
